<p>This page contains videos with testimonials from two editors of
	the Book of Disquiet and the editor of the LdoD Archive. Teresa Sobral
	Cunha and Jerónimo Pizarro were interviewed in November and December
	2015, respectively. Manuel Portela was interviewed in August 2017. The
	interviews were edited according to topics related to both the material
	and editorial history of the Book of Disquiet and the nature of the
	LdoD Archive as a representation and simulation of the editions of the
	Book. In the case of the editors of the Book, the interviews focused on
	a set of questions about their first contact with the materials from
	the Book, their conceptualization of a model for the Book, their
	criteria for selecting and ordering its texts, and their perception
	about the current importance and significance of the Book of Disquiet.
	In the case of the editor of the LdoD Archive, the questions centered
	on the dynamic and simulatory nature of the Archive, and on its
	potential as a textual environment for learning, research and
	creativity. There is also a brief introduction to the LdoD Archive,
	showing excerpts from autographs and editions of two texts: "Amo, pelas
	tardes demoradas de verão" and "Sinfonia de uma noite inquieta,"" which
	are read, respectively, by Jerónimo Pizarro and Teresa Sobral Cunha.
	The topics of each video are referenced through intertitles, according
	to the sequence described below. Recording and editing of all videos:
