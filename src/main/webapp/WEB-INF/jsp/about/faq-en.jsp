<h3>The Archive</h3>
<p>
	The <em>LdoD Archive</em> consists of a group of fragments that
	Fernando Pessoa explicitly attributed to the <em>Book of Disquiet</em>
	and another group, without the indication "L. do D.", which its editors
	have chosen based on material or stylistic evidence from the autograph
	witnesses.
</p>
<p>
	For each fragment the <em>Archive</em> contains the set of
	interpretations associated with it. An interpretation is constituted by
	a transcription of the text and a set of metadata about it, such as
	date or heteronym attribution, or the indication of the shelf-mark of
	the National Library of Portugal that identifies the authorial source.
	The various editors of the Book have produced interpretations that may
	differ in both transcription and metadata. Thus, in the <em>LdoD
		Archive</em>, a fragment has interpretations by its editors (editorial
	interpretations), and it may occur that some of the editors do not
	consider a given fragment as part of the <em>Book of Disquiet</em>, in
	which case there will be no interpretation associated with that expert.
	In addition, a fragment has one or more interpretations of the
	authorial sources (authorial interpretations), and there may be several
	authorial interpretations of the same fragment due, for example, to the
	existence of several manuscripts or typescripts for the same text. The
	transcription and metadata associated with an authorial interpretation
	is the responsibility of the <em>LdoD Archive</em> team.
</p>
<h5>What is a fragment in the LdoD Archive?</h5>
<p>
	A fragment is a modular textual sequence and it constitutes the basic
	unit of composition of the <em>Book</em>. Most textual sequences are
	also separated material units, since they are written in single loose
	sheets (or small groups of loose sheets) without a defined relative
	ordering. The fragments encoded in the <em>LdoD Archive</em> correspond
	to the sum of all texts that were considered as belonging to or
	associated with the <em>Book of Disquiet</em> by the four critical
	editions, including those texts that are published as appendix or annex
	to the main text.
</p>
<h5>What is an interpretation in the LdoD Archive?</h5>
<p>
	An interpretation is the set formed by a transcription and the metadata
	associated with it. The interpretations of the five versions (i.e., the
	four editions of the experts and the genetic representation of the
	authorial sources) are not totally coincident with each other, either
	because of micro-textual variations and differences (transcription of
	certain passages, internal ordering of paragraphs, relative division of
	fragments, for example), or by macro-textual variations (i.e., relative
	ordering of the fragment within the architecture of the <em>Book</em>,
	inclusion or exclusion of a given fragment from the corpus of the <em>Book</em>).
</p>
<h5>Why do fragments have more than one editorial interpretation
	for the same editor?</h5>
<p>This is because editors sometimes split a fragment or associate
	multiple fragments. For example, an editor may consider a given
	fragment as being a single text and another editor may consider it to
	be two distinct texts, which means that for the first editor the
	Archive associates a single interpretation to that fragment while for
	the second editor it associates two interpretations.</p>
<h5>What is the authorial interpretation representative of a
	fragment?</h5>
<p>It is the authorial interpretation of a printed source, if it
	exists; if a printed source does not exist, it is the interpretation of
	a typescript source; and if a typescript source does not exist, it is
	the interpretation of a manuscript source. It is necessary to define a
	representative authorial interpretation in order to have a reference
	transcription, for example, for calculating the textual similarity
	between two fragments when using the recommendation algorithm.</p>
<h3>Authorial Sources</h3>
<h5>What are the authorial sources?</h5>
<p>
	The authorial sources are the interpretations of the fragments made up
	of genetic transcriptions of handwritten and typewritten autographs,
	and also of printed texts published by Pessoa, all of which have been
	encoded by the <em>LdoD Archive</em> team. In addition to the
	transcription, there is a set of metadata about the documentary
	witnesses (material and medium of the inscription, paper size, other
	document features, BNP shelf-mark, etc.).
</p>
<h5>What is a genetic transcription?</h5>
<p>It is a transcription that allows you to observe the authorial
	writing and revision process, recording all layers of textual
	composition and not just the final version. Deletions, additions,
	substitutions, and transpositions made during and after the initial
	stage of writing have been marked up.</p>
<h5>What can we see in the interface for visualizing authorial
	sources?</h5>
<p>This interface allows you to see the transcription of an
	authorial witness that respects the topography of line breaks and the
	distribution of spaces of the original. It also allows you to see the
	textual elements canceled, substituted, added or transposed by Fernando
	Pessoa, as well as the digital facsimile of the original documents. All
	textual variants are also represented, that is, those textual passages
	for which there are two or more alternatives.</p>
<h5>What is facsimile?</h5>
<p>
	A facsimile is a digital image of the original document, which is
	represented by the page unit (with the exception of published sources,
	in which the double spread is used). The <em>Archive</em> includes
	images of all written documents whose text has been assigned or related
	to the <em>Book</em>. There are therefore sheets represented by <em>recto</em>
	pages only, and others by <em>recto </em>and <em>verso </em>pages.
</p>
<h3>Experts&rsquo; Editions</h3>
<h5>What are the experts&rsquo; editions?</h5>
<p>
	The editions by the experts included in the Archive are the main
	critical editions published between 1982 and 2012. These four critical
	editions (prepared from the autographs) were organized, respectively,
	by Jacinto do Prado Coelho (1982; reprinted 1997), Teresa Sobral Cunha
	(2008; 1st ed. 1990-1991), Richard Zenith (2012; 1st ed. 1998), and
	Jer&oacute;nimo Pizarro (2010). The sequence of presentation of the
	experts' editions in the menu corresponds to the chronological order of
	the date of their original publication. The editions by the experts are
	therefore very significant both from a philological point of view, and
	from the point of view of the socialization of the work. Although the
	relative scale of each critical apparatus varies considerably, those
	four editors have worked from the originals with the aim of producing a
	readable integral version of the <em>Book</em>. In addition, these
	editions have determined the dissemination of the <em>Book of
		Disquiet</em> since 1982, both in Portuguese and in other languages, since
	they were taken as a basis for other Portuguese editions and for
	numerous translations. With the exception of Jacinto do Prado Coelho's
	edition, which was reprinted only once without changes after its
	editor's death, all other editions have been altered and corrected
	whenever there is a new publication. The Jacinto do Prado Coelho
	(1920-1984)&rsquo;s edition is historically significant because it was
	the first, and the other three are historically significant because
	they demonstrate the possibility of reediting and reorganizing the <em>Book.</em>
	The Jer&oacute;nimo Pizarro edition is also significant for having
	ordered the texts by date of composition and for having developed a
	systematic and exhaustive critical-genetic apparatus.
</p>
<h5>Why were these specific experts&rsquo; editions selected?</h5>
<p>
	Because these four editions (Coelho 1982; Sobral Cunha 2008; Zenith
	2012; and Pizarro 2010) were the latest editions when we began encoding
	the files for the <em>LdoD Archive</em> in the year 2012. The 1982
	edition (reprinted only once in 1997) is the only one that has not
	changed. The other three editions have continued to undergo a number of
	changes (in the corpus, in the transcription, in the ordering of
	texts), although they have maintained their basic structure and
	principles of organization. In the meantime (i.e., since 2012) new
	editions have already been published (Cunha 2013 and 2016; Pizarro 2013
	and 2014; Zenith 2015).
</p>
<h5>Will the experts' editions be updated in the future?</h5>
<p>
	While the experts have expressed their desire to see the latest version
	of their editions represented in the <em>LdoD Archive</em>, a future
	update will depend on resources available to re-encode the files so
	that they can reflect changes made in a particular new edition. In
	order to guarantee the philological rigor of our scholarly work, it is
	necessary that the interpretations contained in the <em>LdoD
		Archive</em> for representing the experts&rsquo; editions correspond to a
	specific witness (in this case, the editions Coelho-1982, Sobral
	Cunha-2008, Zenith-2012 and Pizarro- 2010), and not to an eclectic
	combination of readings collected in different editions of the text.
</p>
<h3>Edition Comparison</h3>
<h5>What is the edition comparison interface for?</h5>
<p>
	The edition comparison interface has been designed to relate the
	various interpretations of the same fragment (i.e., the interpretations
	of the authorial sources and the interpretations of experts&rsquo;
	editions) to each other. The parallel segmentation and visualization of
	the fragments allows you to compare the transcriptions of each
	fragment, as well as their relative position within the order of the <em>Book.</em>
</p>
<h5>What does the &ldquo;highlight differences&rdquo; view show?</h5>
<p>This feature shows the points of variation between the
	interpretations being compared. These variation points are highlighted
	in blue within the body of the text, and they are also presented in the
	form of a table following the text at the bottom of the page. The
	variations in the shades of blue highlight the relative amount of
	variation: the existence of variation in a single interpretation
	results in the lighter blue shade and the existence of variations in
	all interpretations results in the darker blue shade, and there are
	also two intermediate shades.</p>
<h5>Which are the differentiation units for highlighting?</h5>
<p>
	The differentiation units for highlighting can be of four types: (a)
	word or group of words, (b) punctuation mark, (c) sentence or group of
	sentences, and (d) part of a fragment or an entire fragment. The <em>word
		or group of words</em> highlight indicates orthographic variations or
	substantive variations in the compared transcriptions. For example, the
	Prado Coelho-1982 and Pizarro-2010 editions follow the spelling of the
	original document while the Cunha-2008 and Zenith-2012 editions
	modernize the spelling according to the orthographic standard at the
	time of publication. These cases are indicated in the table of
	variations by the typology "orthographic" (that is, orthographic
	variation), while substantive variations in transcription (for example,
	when the experts choose different variants or read a particular passage
	differently) are marked in the table of variations by the typology
	"substantive" (that is, substantive variation). The <em>punctuation
		mark</em> highlight indicates that the compared transcriptions do not
	punctuate a particular passage in the same way. These cases are marked
	in the table of variations by the typology "punctuation" (that is,
	variation of punctuation). Highlighting <em>a sentence or a group
		of</em> <em>sentences</em> indicates that one or more transcriptions divide
	paragraphs differently. These cases are indicated in the table of
	variations by the typology "paragraph" (that is, variation in the
	division of paragraphs). Highlighting <em>part or the entire
		fragment</em> indicates that the compared editions have split the fragments
	differently, that is, the match is not one text to one text, but one to
	two or to more than two texts. In these cases, the table of variations
	only indicates those macro-textual differences &ndash; it is necessary
	to see the <em>highlights within the text itself</em> in order to
	identify other points of variation on the lower scale of the word or
	group of words, punctuation mark, and sentence or group of sentences.
</p>
<h5>What does the comparison reveal about the editions?</h5>
<p>
	The comparison provides a better understanding of each edition and
	makes explicit editorial criteria that are not always stated in the
	general editorial principles, both for individual transcriptions and
	for the overall ordering of fragments. For instance, the automatic
	comparison enables you to see several options and editorial
	interventions in terms of reading passages that are difficult to
	decipher, choosing variants, punctuating texts, dividing/aggregating
	paragraphs, and dividing/aggregating fragments. The comparison (not
	only of these four editions against each other, but also when we exmine
	the history of each expert&rsquo;s edition) reveals that, over time,
	the readings of difficult-to-read passages (and for which conjectural
	readings were originally offered) shows less variation across the
	editions, since newly deciphered passages, with a greater probability
	of being correct, are incorporated in subsequent editions,
	demonstrating that the experts cooperate in the effort to read the
	Pessoa&rsquo;s handwriting, which is often idiosyncratic and variable.
	Although at the granular scale of deciphering characters and words
	there is less variation among editions over time, the comparison
	further reveals that the editors who continued to re-edit the text
	(Sobral Cunha, Zenith, and Pizarro) are consistent in the original
	macro-organization of fragments in their respective editions, which
	remain faithful to the structure and model that they initially
	conceived. With the exception of minor changes, the ordering of the
	fragments in the <em>Book </em>has remained stable from edition to
	edition. At the scale of the <em>Book</em>, comparisons across the
	experts&rsquo; editions corpus allow us to prove the existence of four
	distinct models for producing the <em>Book of Disquiet.</em>
</p>
<h5>Is it possible to compare an editorial or authorial
	interpretation with a virtual interpretation?</h5>
<p>No, because a virtual interpretation never changes the
	transcription of the interpretation it uses.</p>
<h5>What does the comparison of fragments&rsquo; annotations in
	virtual editions show?</h5>
<p>In this interface it is possible to compare the annotations that
	the virtual editors applied on the virtual interpretations. For
	example, what was cited, and what notes and tags were associated with
	the citation by the virtual editors. Note that the comparison is
	between interpretations of the same fragment even when the base
	interpretation used is not the same.</p>
<h3>Search</h3>
<p>The search allows you to select fragments according to a set of
	criteria.</p>
<h5>What is simple search?</h5>
<p>In simple search it is possible to select the set of fragments
	according to two criteria: text and type of source. The text criterion
	can be applied to the entire textual transcription or only to its
	title. The result is the set of interpretations that include the
	textual string entered in the search field. It should be noted that the
	search result may include several interpretations associated with the
	same fragment (i.e., authorial interpretations and editorial
	interpretations).</p>
<h5>Which characters are allowed in the search criteria by text?</h5>
<p>Only alpha-numeric characters, hyphen, ampersand and space are
	allowed. All other characters are ignored, for example, when entering
	"al*ma" in the search field the result will include all interpretations
	where the word "alma" appears. Note that there is no distinction
	between lowercase and uppercase, so in the previous example the result
	will also include those interpretations where the word "Alma" appears.</p>
<h5>What is advanced search?</h5>
<p>
	In advanced search you can use a larger set of criteria. In addition,
	it is possible to perform a search by combining the criteria in two
	ways: according to <em>all of the criteria</em> or according to <em>only
		one of the criteria</em>. If it meets all the criteria, the result will
	contain the fragments that for each of the defined criteria have at
	least one interpretation that satisfies one criterion. For example, in
	a search where "alma liberdade" is introduced in the text field, and
	"Vicente Guedes" is chosen in the heteronym field, the result will
	include all the fragments that have at least one interpretation that
	use both words in their text and that have at least one interpretation
	that attributes the fragment to Vicente Guedes. Note that it does not
	need to be the same interpretation to satisfy both criteria, it is only
	required that they are interpretations of the same fragment. In case
	the search is according to at least one of the criteria, the result
	will contain all the fragments that have an interpretation that
	satisfies at least one of the criteria. Using the previous example, the
	result will include fragments that have at least one interpretation
	attributed to Vicente Guedes or that have the words "alma" and
	"liberdade." In both cases, the search result includes the
	interpretations of the selected fragments, indicating which criteria
	each interpretation satisfies, and thus justifying the reason why the
	fragment was selected.
</p>
<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>
	The reading interface offers the possibility of reading the fragments
	of the <em>Book of Disquiet</em>, according to the sequences proposed
	by each of its editors. In addition, the <em>Archive </em>recommends a
	reading sequence based on weights (ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, with
	intervals of 0.2) that the user can assign to four criteria: heteronym,
	date, text, and taxonomy. For the fragment that the user is currently
	reading the system recommends what it considers closest according to a
	measure of distance between fragments.
</p>
<h5>How is the distance between two fragments calculated?</h5>
<p>
	It is calculated by applying the <a
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity">cosine
		similarity</a> to the constructed vectors for each of the four criteria.
	When comparing two fragments, their similarity is calculated using the
	vectors of the criteria for which the user assigned a non-zero weight.
	The criteria vectors are constructed using the information associated
	with all the interpretations of the fragment multiplied by the weight
	assigned by the user to that criterion, a value between 0.2 and 1.0.
</p>
<h5>How is the vector associated with the heteronym?</h5>
<p>The heteronym vector has two cells, one for each of the
	heteronyms, Vicente Guedes and Bernardo Soares. A cell has a value of
	1.0 if at least one of the interpretations assigns the heteronomy of
	the fragment to the heteronym associated with that cell and 0.0
	otherwise. For example, if a fragment is attributed to Vicente Guedes
	by one of the editors and to Bernardo Soares by two of the other
	editors, the heteronym vector will have 1.0 in both cells.</p>
<h5>How is the vector associated with the date calculated?</h5>
<p>
	The date vector has 22 cells, one for each of the years between the
	year of the first fragment assigned to the <em>Book,</em> 1913, and the
	year of the last assigned fragment, 1934. If, for example, two
	interpretations assign different dates to one fragment, their
	respective cells will have a value of 1.0 and the rest will be filled
	with values of less than 1.0 with a decay of MAX (0.0, 1.0 - N x 0.1)
	in which N is the distance between the year associated with the cell
	and the nearest cell with value 1.0.
</p>
<h5>How is the vector associated with the text calculated?</h5>
<p>
	Initially, the set of the first 100 <a
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf">tf-idf</a> (<em>term
		frequency-inverse document frequency</em>) of the terms of each of the two
	fragments being compared are calculated. Note that this set has N terms
	that can be less than 200, 100 terms for each of the fragments, in case
	there are equal terms in both fragments. Then a vector is created, with
	a number of cells equal to N, the cardinality of the set, in which the
	cell associated with a term has the value 1.0 if it appears in the set
	of the first N terms <em>td-idf</em> of that fragment, and 0.0
	otherwise. Since words on a fragment vary according to transcription,
	the transcription associated with a representative authorial
	interpretation is used.
</p>
<h5>How is the vector associated with taxonomy calculated?</h5>
<p>
	The vector has a number of cells equal to the number of tags in the <em>LdoD
		Archive Edition</em> taxonomy. The cell associated with a category has a
	value of 1.0 if the interpretation of the fragment in the <em>LdoD
		Archive Edition</em> has assigned that category to any tag, and has a value
	of 0.0 otherwise.
</p>
<h5>What does the reading recommendation mean when all weights in
	the criteria are set to zero?</h5>
<p>It means there is no similarity between the fragments, i.e., the
	value of similarity between any two fragments is 0.0.</p>
<h5>The similarity is calculated between fragments, but what the
	Archive recommends for reading is an interpretation and not a fragment,
	why?</h5>
<p>Similarity is calculated between the fragments, but the reading
	must be done using the transcription of one of the interpretations.
	Thus, the transcription associated with the edition whose transcription
	the user is currently reading is suggested for reading.</p>
<h5>Can fragments that have been recommended be recommended again?</h5>
<p>
	Only those fragments that have not been read since the user started a
	reading sequence are recommended, but if there are only 50 fragments
	remaining, the <em>Archive</em> will again consider the first 50
	fragments read for its recommendation.
</p>
<h5>Can more than one fragment be recommended?</h5>
<p>Yes, the system suggests the most similar fragment to the one
	that is being read plus all fragments whose difference between their
	similarity value and the suggested similarity value is less than 0.001,
	up to a maximum of 5 fragments. Note that the suggested fragment is the
	most similar that has an interpretation in the edition of the
	transcription that is currently being read.</p>
<h5>Why is it that after a fragment interpretation is recommended,
	no further interpretation of the same fragment is recommenced, even if
	the interpretation read is from an edition that has two interpretations
	for that fragment?</h5>
<p>This is because the mechanism of recommendation of
	interpretations for reading is based on the calculation of the
	similarity between fragments.</p>
<h3>Virtual Edition</h3>
<p>A virtual edition is a selection of fragments that one or more
	users define by choosing from among existing interpretations. A virtual
	edition is a unique entity because it allows its virtual editors to
	choose the fragments they want to include, their ordering, and their
	annotation through notes and categories. The set of categories
	associated with a virtual edition defines its taxonomy.</p>
<h5>What is LdoD Archive Edition?</h5>
<p>
	It is an experimental edition of the <em>LdoD Archive</em> that uses
	the representative authorial interpretation of each of the fragments.
	It also includes a taxonomy for the <em>Book of Disquiet</em> defined
	by the editors of the <em>Archive</em>, who additionally have annotated
	the interpretations using the categories of that taxonomy.
</p>
<h5>How can I create a virtual edition?</h5>
<p>In the virtual interface you can create a new virtual edition.
	The virtual edition can use an already existing expert or virtual
	edition as its base, thus inheriting all the information associated
	with the base edition. If an edition is not chosen as the base, the new
	virtual edition starts without having any associated interpretation. In
	case of using a virtual edition as a base, the new virtual edition
	contains all notes about the fragments that were made at the level of
	the base edition. However, it is not possible to change these
	annotations at the level of the new virtual edition, but if they are
	changed at the level of its base edition, by editors of the base
	edition, the effects of the changes are visible in the new virtual
	edition. This criterion was chosen to respect the authorship of the
	annotations.</p>
<h5>Can a virtual edition have more than one interpretation of the
	same fragment?</h5>
<p>No, it is only possible to associate one interpretation per
	fragment with a virtual edition.</p>
<h5>How do I add an interpretation to a virtual edition?</h5>
<p>There are several ways to associate an interpretation of a
	fragment with a virtual edition: (a) when the interpretation is being
	viewed on the edition comparison screen, it is possible to add it
	individually if it is not already part of the virtual edition; (2) in
	the manual sorting interface of the virtual edition you can also search
	for fragments and add them to the virtual edition.</p>
<h5>How can I remove an interpretation of a virtual edition?</h5>
<p>In the manual sorting interface of the virtual edition you can
	select one or more interpretations and remove them.</p>
<h5>Who can add to and remove interpretations from a virtual
	edition?</h5>
<p>All editors of the virtual edition.</p>
<h5>Can I collaborate with other people in building a virtual
	edition?</h5>
<p>Yes, a virtual edition can have multiple editors. There are two
	types of role for participants in a virtual edition: managers and
	editors. Managers can add new members to the virtual edition, they just
	need to know which is their User Name. On the other hand, managers can
	accept requests from new editors for joining a virtual edition. Any
	user can apply to join a public virtual edition. A manager can remove
	another user from the list of editors or change his/her role. Note that
	managers are also, inherently, editors, thus having all the privileges
	of an editor.</p>
<h5>What distinguishes a public virtual edition from a private one?</h5>
<p>
	A private edition is only visible and can only be manipulated by its
	editors. A public edition is visible to the entire <em>LdoD
		Archive</em> community, but can only be altered by its editors, with the
	exception of annotations in those cases where creation of annotations
	is allowed to authenticated users. Only managers of a virtual edition
	can change the state of the edition from private to public, as well as
	its name and acronym.
</p>
<h5>How can I annotate the interpretations of a virtual edition?</h5>
<p>Interpretations of a virtual edition can be annotated manually
	and automatically. Manual annotation can be applied to the entire
	transcription or to a portion of the transcription text. Manual
	annotation occurs in the edition comparison interface. Manual
	annotation of a portion of text is done by selecting the text, and then
	a comment can be associated with the annotation as well as a set of
	categories of the taxonomy of the virtual edition. Manual annotation of
	the whole transcription can be viewed in the same interface as the
	annotation of a portion, but in the former case the categories are
	associated with the whole transcription. Of course, in the same
	annotation interface it is also possible to remove comments and their
	categories. The automatic annotation of the interpretations of a
	virtual edition occurs when the topic-generating algorithm is applied,
	within the interface of the virtual edition, resulting in the
	annotation the transcription of those interpretations with the
	generated categories.</p>
<h5>Who can annotate interpretations of a virtual edition?</h5>
<p>In the taxonomy interface, within the virtual edition, managers
	of the virtual edition can indicate who can annotate an interpretation.
	Two possibilities are offered: the creation of annotations is
	restricted to editors of the virtual edition; or any authenticated user
	can create annotations. With regard to editing and removing
	annotations, only the user who created them can perform these
	operations.</p>
<h5>How do you define the set of categories of a taxonomy?</h5>
<p>The taxonomy of a virtual edition can be open or closed,
	depending on whether you can or cannot add new categories when
	annotating an interpretation. The annotation of an interpretation
	occurs in the interface for edition comparison. In cases where the
	taxonomy is open, the set of categories increases whenever a category
	not existing in the taxonomy is included in an annotation. On the other
	hand, for both open and closed taxonomies, it is possible to change the
	existing set of categories through category creation operations, such
	as joining two or more categories, separating one category into two,
	and category removal. This manipulation of the set of taxonomy
	categories is done through the virtual edition taxonomy interface. It
	is also possible to automatically increase the number of categories of
	a virtual edition by applying the topic-generation algorithm.</p>
<h5>Who can define whether a taxonomy is open or closed?</h5>
<p>In the taxonomy interface, within a virtual edition, virtual
	edition managers can define whether the taxonomy is open or closed.</p>
<h5>What is the topic-generation algorithm?</h5>
<p>
	The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model">topic-generation
		algorithm</a> groups the interpretations of the virtual edition into
	topics. Each of these topics is included in the taxonomy as a new
	category. In the generation process, the user can indicate how many
	different topics he/she wants to see generated, the number of words
	he/she will have in the name of the new category (the most relevant
	words in the topic are chosen), the similarity value in order for an
	interpretation to be included in the topic (so that the interpretation
	can be automatically annotated by its category), and the number of
	iterations that the algorithm must execute before generating the topics
	(iterations must be between 1500 and 2000 in order for the results to
	be reliable). Through the application of the algorithm, an
	interpretation can be associated with several categories. For automatic
	generation of topics, one must access the taxonomy in the interface of
	the virtual edition.
</p>
<h5>Who can change the categories of a virtual edition?</h5>
<p>In the taxonomy interface, within a virtual edition, managers can
	define whether it is only managers who can manipulate the categories,
	or whether all editors of the virtual edition can do so.</p>
<h5>Can I use the base edition taxonomy categories in my virtual
	edition annotations?</h5>
<p>
	Yes, when using a virtual edition in the creation of a new virtual
	edition you can use the categories of the base taxonomy to annotate the
	interpretations in the new virtual edition. These categories are
	prefixed with the acronym, in uppercase, of the virtual edition used.
	Note that if a category used is deleted or its name is changed in the
	base virtual edition, these changes are reflected in the annotation
	that used that category in the new virtual edition because the <em>LdoD
		Archive</em> preserves the authorship of the annotations.
</p>
<h5>How can I reorder the interpretations in a virtual edition?</h5>
<p>
	There are two modes for reordering the interpretations: a manual mode
	and an assisted mode. The manual mode occurs in the editing interface
	of the virtual edition and consists of the selection of the
	interpretations whose position we intend to change followed by their
	placement in a new position. It is also possible to change the ordering
	of the interpretations in a virtual edition using the recommendation
	algorithm of the virtual edition. This is called the assisted mode. The
	recommendation algorithm is identical to that used in the reading
	recommendation, with the difference that the taxonomy similarity
	naturally uses the taxonomy of the virtual edition, rather than the
	taxonomy of the <em>LdoD Archive Edition</em>. Once the recommendation
	algorithm is applied, all interpretations are ordered starting from the
	first, i.e. the second interpretation is the most similar to the first,
	and the third is the most similar to the second, excluding the first
	interpretation, and so on. To generate a new order, you can change the
	criteria or place another interpretation as the initial one. Once the
	ordering has been changed by the recommendation algorithm, it can be
	saved, leading to a redefinition of the numbering associated with each
	interpretation.

<h5>Who can reorder the interpretations in a virtual edition?</h5>
<p>All the editors of that virtual edition.</p>
<h5>When a virtual edition is created which are its default
	settings?</h5>
<p>By default the virtual editors can annotate the interpretations,
	but this possibility is not allowed to authenticated users; only
	managers can change the categories of the taxonomy; and the vocabulary
	of the taxonomy is open.</p>
<h5>What might be some of the typical scenarios associated with
	creating virtual editions?</h5>
<ul>
	<li>(a) A teacher decides to create a virtual edition so that
		his/her students can annotate the fragments according to a predefined
		taxonomy. In this scenario the virtual edition is private, only the
		teacher and the students will have access, the teacher being the
		virtual edition manager and the students its editors. Only the teacher
		can manipulate the categories of the taxonomy, and the students can
		annotate the interpretations. The vocabulary of taxonomy is closed.</li>
	<li>(b) A researcher wishes to conduct a study on the social
		interpretation of the <em>Book of Disquiet </em>which involves the
		participation of a non-predefined number of persons. In order to do
		this he/she creates a public virtual edition of which he/she is the
		only editor and manager, defines the taxonomy vocabulary as open and
		gives annotation access to all authenticated users. Once the virtual
		edition is set up, he/she disseminates the experiment through social
		networks requesting that interested participants register in the <em>LdoD
			Archive</em> and begin to annotate the interpretations, either by creating
		new categories or using the already existing categories.
	</li>
	<li>(c) A group of Humanities students wishes to supplement the <em>LdoD
			Archive Edition</em> with an additional set of categories and annotations.
		In order to do this they create a new virtual edition that uses <em>LdoD
			Archive Edition </em>as its base, restrict annotation to its editors, and
		allow all of them to change taxonomy categories. In this scenario the
		taxonomy vocabulary should be open.
	</li>
	<li>(d) A lover of the work of Pessoa wishes to make his/her own
		edition of the <em>Book</em>. For this s/he creates a private virtual
		edition without using any of the existing ones. S/he adds the
		interpretations s/he considers to be relevant, defining their specific
		order. Additionally s/he defines this editions&rsquo; taxonomy and
		annotates the interpretations. When s/he finishes the edition, s/he
		makes it public and announces its publication. In this scenario, there
		is only one editor, who is also the manager. This editor-manager can
		create categories for a taxonomy with an open vocabulary to annotate
		the interpretations, but other users cannot annotate interpretations.
